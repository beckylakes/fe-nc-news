// Here are features I am yet to implement (but fully intend on doing so in the next few weeks!):
# 1 More Error Handling
If the sort_by is invalid currently no error messages are displayed. Also when topic is not found, if click checking out some articles, it won't refresh the page, so the error message won't disappear (because topic is the query, not different route so still on the same page).

# 2 CSS
General App design needs doing! I plan on also implementing some key accessibility features to help those with screenreaders/help with page navigation/make colours stand out better/improve rendering so that those with slower internet speed aren't too affected!

# 3 Make Error Page into an Error Message instead? (Potential!)
